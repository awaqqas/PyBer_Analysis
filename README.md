# PyBer_Analysis

**Overview of the analysis **

The purpose of this analysis was to perform an exploratory analysis of the Pyber ride-sharing data to further understand the varying fareship and ridership by city type in which Pyber operates. Various tables and a line graph was created to create a visual depiction of the fareship by month from Jan-1-2019 to April-29-2019. Upon analyzing the line graph, V. Isualize can note the total weekly fares for each city type and conclude that urban city types are performing better than rural and suburban city types. This could be due to access to rides and affordability of the rides to the consumers in rural and suburban areas. V. Isualize can look at this graph and determine best possible method to improve farehsip and ridership for both rural and suburban city types.

**Results**

A statistical summary of the Pyber ride data is as follows

Upon examination of the table, following factors could be noted:
- Highest number of rides are taken by urban riders for total number of 1,625 rides followed by suburban and rural areas. 
- Urban cities have 4x more drivers than suburban cities 
- Suburban cities have 6x more drivers than rural cities with four times more revenue
- Urban city types have majority of the drivers totalling upto 2,405 drivers. 
- As expected, majority of the fares also comes from the urban riders toalling upto 39,854.38 US dollars. 
- It is interesting to note that avergae fare per ride is highest for rural areas where number of rides and number of drivers are lowest-averaging up to 34.62 US dollars per ride. 
- While, this impacts the rider negatively, the driver is positively impacted as average fare by driver is also highest for rural city types; averaging upto 55.49 US dollars per driver. 

Overall, fareship is highest where ride to driver ratio is lowest and demand is high, i.e. in this case urban cities. The line graph depicts this analysis to be true as well:

**Summary**

Upon analyzing both the graph and the table, my recommendation would be the following for the CEO of Pyber:
1) Increase the number of drivers in rural areas as the ride to driver ratio is highest. This means that the demand could possibly be not met as the number of drivers are low. 
2) Rural city Riders are also paying high fares; indicating that riders could be discouraged from using Pyber service for their needs and may resort to other cheaper alternatives. Perhaps, reducing the fares could imporove the number of rides in rural areas
3) For suburban cities adding more drivers would help the rides to driver ratio and also bring down the average fare per ride cost on the rider as well. The average fare by ride cost is close to urban cities 34 (suburban) and 30 (urban) as such this could be equalized with the urban city fares with the addition of extra drivers in suburban areas as well.
4) Lastly, average fare per driver seems to be lowest in Urban city types, perhaps due to short distances covered by these drivers. This further strengthens the argument of increasing the number of drivers in rural and suburban city types as these drivers are also occupied with covering long distances; thereby creating a demand (available rides) and supply (driver availability) issue.
